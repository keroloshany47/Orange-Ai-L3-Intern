# Orange-DC-AI-L3-Intern

This repository documents the tasks, notebooks, and presentations I completed during the **AI L3 Internship at Orange Digital Center**. The internship focused on applying AI techniques to solve real-world problems in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Computer Vision**, **Generative Models**, and **MLOps**.

##  About the Repository

This repo includes all my work from the internship, organized into clear sections:

-  **NLP Notebooks & Models**
-  **Computer Vision (YOLOv8)**
-  **GANs vs VAEs**
-  **MLOps Concepts**
-  **Presentations & Reports**

Each folder includes practical implementations, results, and resources that reflect what I learned and applied throughout the program.

##  Technologies & Concepts Explored

- **Transformers (BERT)**: Used pre-trained models for Arabic sentiment classification and explored fine-tuning techniques.
- **Text Embeddings**: Applied word/sentence embeddings for NLP tasks.
- **NLP Preprocessing**: Specialized techniques for Arabic, including normalization, token cleaning, and stopword removal.
- **YOLOv8**: Used for object detection and classification in images.
- **GANs & VAEs**: Compared two generative models and built example pipelines using PyTorch.
- **MLOps**: Learned the fundamentals of model deployment, containerization with Docker, and production-level thinking in ML workflows.

##  What I Gained

Through this internship, I worked hands-on with a wide range of AI tools and concepts. I didn't just follow tutorials—I built, tested, and modified real models. I gained confidence in:

- Applying deep learning techniques to Arabic language processing.
- Understanding the architecture and logic behind object detection models.
- Experimenting with generative models and analyzing their performance.
- Thinking beyond notebooks—towards how models are deployed and scaled in real systems.
